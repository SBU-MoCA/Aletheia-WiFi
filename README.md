# Aletheia-WiFi

## Introduction
Aletheia consists of two parts:

1. Aletheia edge enables its users to offline/live selectively log data of interest on low-end robust hardware for wireless research/development. 
2. Aletheia analyzer enables its users to select subset of logged medium data, tag and view frames based on custom general attributes defined by user or conditional.


Aletheia is a tool built for distributed low-end robust wireless R&D platforms (e.g., raspberry pis, jetson, etc.).
